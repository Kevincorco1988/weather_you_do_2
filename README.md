# weather_you_do

# "Weather You Do" API weather app - My final project here at UCD Professional Academy.

### Introduction: Kevin Corcoran
I have done little bits of coding before and enjoyed it but have really enjoyed the challenges of this course. 
It has pushed me to out of my comfort zone and showed me what I'm capable of, I'm far from the finished article but 
hope that time will help me fill in the gaps. I have throughly enjoyed the challenges of the projects thus far.

## The Scope Plane

### Requirements and Functional Specifications

**Owner Goals**
   - Make the app easy to navigate and use across all devices and screen sizes
   - To get right to the point on the landing page.
   - Have a register user section to add new users and a login area for existing users to log in.
   - Be able to function well to organise the users profile, and give them a nice personalised experience.
   - Have responsive sign up and log in forms with the ability to see errors and submit

**First-time/Repeat User Goals**
   - To make it easy for the users to use and access the information that they need.
   - Give the users a personalised experience on the app.


## The Structure Plane

### **Interaction Design**
   - **Consistent:** I tried to be consistent with the colors used, the layout of headings, navigation and footers
   - **Predictable:** The layout consistency makes it predcictable how the next page should look
   - **Learnable:** Its predictability and simple navigation makes it easy to learn
   - **Visible:** Everything is clearly visible due to the mixture of colors and layout
   - **Feedback:** The forms have validations and errors to identity the issues or successes using crispy forms method.

### **Information Archictecture**
The layout of the app was structured to proviude a user-friendly experience by allowing the user to move through the app freely and not get lost along the way. The header with has the navigation bar and dashboard is visible on the home page to make searching the app easy.

## The Skeleton Plane
I wanted the app to be structured in the most user-friendly way by add the right content in the right places. My hope would be that each page would be enough to have the user move to the next one.

The navigation was to be placed at the top of each page for simple movement.

## The Surface Plane

The surface and finshed look of the app is consistent across key areas. The color, color-contrast, layout,  and patterns are all examples of the consistency shown on the surface to the user providing a pleasing experience to the user. 

# Issues and Troubleshooting

Most issues were dealt with . Testing was required regularly as new features were added. The unit testing was challenging but google search helped provide ideas of how to overcome issues. 
I would like to have added a few more features but due to time, I had to prioritise and I'm happy with what I chose was most important.

# Testing 

All pages passed through the relevant validators at (https://validator.w3.org/) and (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and testing by the console for javascript, python testing was via unit testing on vs code. 

It was also tested via multiple browsers and checked across multiple device types.
